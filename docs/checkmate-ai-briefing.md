# CheckMate AI features — briefing

This note explains how CheckMate’s AI features work: credentials and model selection from FIDO, the connection check, then the five main flows (overview, follow-up, explain, propose fix, apply and validate).

Implementation lives under `checkmate/ai/` (LiteLLM client, session, overview, explain, fix, context, resources). CheckMate does **not** import the FIDO package; it reads FIDO’s on-disk app-data files.

---

## Tech stack (brief)

| Layer | Choice |
|--------|--------|
| App | Python ≥3.10, wxPython UI |
| LLM gateway | [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/) (`checkmate/ai/litellm_client.py`) |
| Rendering | Markdown → HTML for dialogs |
| Providers | Whatever FIDO catalogs (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Mistral, Groq, Gateway, LM Studio, Ollama, …) |

**Completion defaults** (temperature is left to the provider):

| Setting | Value |
|---------|--------|
| Completion timeout | 180s |
| Connection-check timeout | 30s |
| Explain / overview / fix `max_tokens` | 8192 |
| Follow-up `max_tokens` | 4096 |

Provider quirks are handled in `completion_output_kwargs()` (e.g. GPT-5 uses `max_completion_tokens`; some Gemini models disable thinking).

---

## Reading user prefs from FIDO

CheckMate reads JSON from FIDO’s app-data directory (`fido_settings.py`):

- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\fido\`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/fido/`
- Linux: `~/.fido/`

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `user_settings.json` | Model selection (`unified_llm_model`, optional `checkmate_model` / `describer_model`, `single_llm_for_all_services`) |
| `api_keys.json` | Provider API keys; optional `unlock_code` |
| `services.json` | Catalog: LiteLLM model id + which key field to use |

**Model selection order** (`selected_model_service_string()`):

1. If `single_llm_for_all_services` is true (FIDO default) → `unified_llm_model`
2. Else → `checkmate_model`, then `describer_model`
3. Else → in-memory unlock session model (if present)

Resolution (`resolve_litellm_model_and_key()`) splits `"Provider: model id"`, looks up the LiteLLM id and key name in `services.json`, and falls back to a small provider map when the catalog is missing. Gateway / LM Studio / Ollama also pick up `api_base` from FIDO keys.

**CheckMate-local settings** (separate from FIDO), e.g. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CheckMate\settings.json`:

- `ai_features_enabled` — Tools → Enable AI features
- `ai_send_file_context` — whether file excerpts are included in explain/fix prompts (default on)
- `show_issues_always` — Tools → Show issues always (default off; opens the issues list automatically after a check that finds issues)

AI features are offered when FIDO settings/keys are present (or unlock supplies credentials).

## Connection check

Before overview, explain, or fix (not before follow-ups on an existing session):

1. Preload LiteLLM on a worker thread
2. Resolve model + API key (`ensure_credentials_ready()`); refresh unlock if needed
3. `ExplainSession.create()` → `check_provider_connection()`

The check is a minimal completion:

- Message: `"Hi"`
- `max_tokens`: 5
- Timeout: 30s

Failures are classified (`timeout`, `no_key`, `network`, `no_model`, `provider_error`, …) and mapped to localized UI strings. A successful check means later prompts reuse the same session credentials without repeating the probe.

---

## Shared runtime pattern

```text
UI action
  → resolve FIDO model/key
  → connection check ("Hi")
  → build system + user prompts (+ assets)
  → litellm.completion via ExplainSession
  → optional truncation continuation / fix repair
  → render markdown (or parse fix JSON)
```

`ExplainSession` holds the message history so follow-ups continue the same conversation.

### Cost logging (logger only)

After each LiteLLM completion (connection check, ask, follow-up/continuation), CheckMate logs estimated **USD cost** and token counts at INFO:

- Cost from `response._hidden_params["response_cost"]`, else `litellm.completion_cost(...)`
- Fields: `cost_usd`, `session_total_usd` (sum within the `ExplainSession`), `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `total_tokens`
- Local / unpriced models log `cost_usd=n/a` — nothing is shown in the UI

---

## 1. AI overview

**Purpose:** Summarize an entire validation report for publishers/remediators.

**Entry:** `explain_overview()` in `ai/overview.py`.

### Assets / context

Built from the check result only (no file excerpts):

- Verdict, headline, fatal/error/warning/info/usage counts
- Tool name/version, publication kind, target name
- Per-checker counts and extra metadata
- Up to **50 unique** `(source, code)` issues, severity-sorted; messages trimmed (~180 chars)

### Prompt shape

**System** — accessibility publishing assistant; reply in the CheckMate UI language; exact H2 structure:

1. Overall assessment  
2. Main themes  
3. Suggested priorities  
4. Practical next steps  
5. Caveats  

Rules emphasize: use only the provided report data; don’t invent issues; group into themes; prioritize fatals/errors; keep sections concise markdown.

**User** — verdict, counts, publication/tool metadata, then the unique-issue list (or “no issues”).

### Params

- `max_tokens`: 8192  
- If the reply looks truncated (`finish_reason` length/max_tokens, or an unclosed ` ``` ` fence), one continuation is requested and merged.

---

## 2. Follow-up questions

Available after a successful **overview** or **issue explain**. The dialog keeps the `ExplainSession` and appends Q&A in the HTML view.

| Context | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Issue explain | `ask_followup()` in `ai/explain.py` |
| Overview | `ask_overview_followup()` in `ai/overview.py` |

### Behaviour

- Reuses full chat history (system + prior turns); **no** second connection check
- `max_tokens`: 4096
- Instructs the model to answer conversationally in the UI language
- Explicitly **not** to reuse the structured H2 layout from the original overview/explain
- Prefer short paragraphs or a few bullets; code only when helpful

---

## 3. AI explanation (single issue)

**Purpose:** Explain one checker message with practical remediation guidance.

**Entry:** `explain_issue()` in `ai/explain.py`.

### Assets

1. **Issue fields** — severity, source, code, location, message, tool, publication kind  
2. **File excerpt** (if `ai_send_file_context` and EPUB/eBraille) — ~±20 lines around the hit, or OPF structural region / capped OPF; Ace locations resolved via CSS/HTML hints when needed  
3. **Trusted resources** — curated URLs per checker (`ai/resources.py`):
   - **Ace:** specific DAISY KB article first (rule id map in `ai/ace_kb_map.py`, or Ace report help URL), then KB homepage / Ace docs
   - **EPUBCheck:** mapped DAISY KB article first when the code is accessibility-oriented (`ACC_*` and selected `HTM_*` / `NAV_*` in `ai/epubcheck_kb_map.py`); otherwise the official [EPUBCheck message reference](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epubcheck/docs/messages/) first; then EPUB a11y guidelines / KB homepage  
   - The model may only cite these under “Learn more”

### Authoritative guidance

When a **primary** reference is known (Ace KB article, EPUBCheck→KB map, or EPUBCheck message catalog):

- The Explain system prompt includes an **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE** block naming that reference
- The model is told to align *What this means* / *Why it matters* / *How to fix* with it, and not invent conflicting requirements
- Learn more should list that reference first
- This is **prompt steering**, not RAG: the URL is provided; the page body is not fetched into the prompt

### Prompt shape

**System** — same assistant role; UI language mandatory; exact H2s:

1. What this means  
2. Why it matters  
3. Where in the file  
4. How to fix  
5. Learn more  

Rules: authoritative guidance when available (else “don’t invent conformance requirements”); prefer concrete EPUB/eBraille steps; “Learn more” only as markdown links from the trusted list.

**User** — issue metadata + optional fenced file excerpt.

### Params

- `max_tokens`: 8192  
- Connection check first; one automatic continuation if truncated

---

## 4. Proposing an AI fix

**Purpose:** Propose a **minimal, unique text replacement** for one issue (EPUB / eBraille only).

**Entry:** `propose_fix()` in `ai/fix.py`.

### Flow

1. Credentials + connection check  
2. Gather issue context + member kind (`opf` / `html` / `css` / `other`)  
3. Ask with fix system/user prompts (`max_tokens` 8192)  
4. Parse markdown rationale + a single ` ```json ` fence → `FixProposal(file, original, replacement, rationale)`  
5. Validate: complete (not truncated/draft); `original` non-empty; occurs **exactly once** in the package member  
6. On failure: one repair follow-up (`_repair_user_prompt`), then re-parse

### Prompt shape

**System** — final answer only (no thinking aloud). Required output:

1. `## Proposed fix` — short rationale in the UI language  
2. Exactly one JSON object with string fields: `file`, `original`, `replacement`

Key rules: minimal edit; never empty `original` (insert-via-replace using a unique nearby anchor); prefer short snippets; may patch related OPF when that’s where the fix belongs; omit JSON if no safe automated fix.

**User** — issue metadata, optional **AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE** (primary Ace KB article, EPUBCheck→KB map, or EPUBCheck message catalog when known — prefer that remediation approach, but still copy patch text only from file excerpts), FILE TYPE guidance, cross-file guidance, **Exact file text** (raw excerpt for copying `original`), optional **Related package document** OPF excerpt.

The UI shows a preview (`format_fix_preview()`: Proposed fix / File / Before / After) before the user applies anything.

### Suggest all like this (multi-patch)

**Purpose:** Same safety model (unique replaces only), but suggest **N patches** for every issue sharing the seed’s **source + code** in the current report.

**Entry:** Issue details → **Suggest all like this…** (enabled when matching count > 1) → `propose_batch_fix()`.

1. `gather_batch_fix_context()` — instance list + per-member Exact file text (caps: ~40 issues, ~12 members, ≤20 patches)  
2. Model returns `## Proposed fix` + JSON `{ "patches": [...], "skipped": [...] }`  
3. Each patch validated sequentially (exactly-once `original` after prior patches in that member)  
4. Preview via `format_batch_fix_preview()`; apply via `apply_proposed_fixes()` → `apply_text_replacements()` in **one** backup/rebuild cycle  
5. Changelog uses `log_batch_fix_applied()`; validation counts matching source+code before/after (`evaluate_fix_outcome(..., batch_mode=True)`)

Single-issue **Suggest fix with AI** is unchanged.

---

## 5. Executing a fix and validating the result

### Apply

1. User clicks **Apply fix and validate** → `apply_proposed_fix()` / `apply_proposed_fixes()` → `epub_package.apply_text_replacement(s)()`  
2. Exact once-replace (with CRLF-normalized fallback); multi-patch applies sequentially per member  
3. Write `.bak` backup(s), then:
   - Exploded folder: edit member(s) in place (extra member `.bak` files recorded for revert)  
   - Packaged `.epub` / `.ebrl`: extract → edit → rebuild  
4. Append an **edit changelog** entry (`edit_log.py`) beside the publication naming the backup file, issue, member(s), and excerpts  
5. On success: issue dialog closes with apply; main window stores `PendingFixVerify` and **re-checks** the publication

### Validate

`evaluate_fix_outcome()` compares the pre-apply `CheckResult` with the post re-check:

| Check | Pass when |
|--------|-----------|
| Target resolved | Single: same issue gone. Batch: matching source+code count is **0** |
| Counts reduced | fatals + errors + warnings decreased |
| Ace side effects | If the fixed issue was Ace: no **new** EPUBCheck fatal/error fingerprints |

`FixVerifyReport.has_concerns` is true if the target is still present, counts did not drop, or an Ace fix introduced new EPUBCheck errors.

**UI outcomes:**

- No concerns → “Fix confirmed” (logged as `confirmed`)  
- Concerns (and backup exists) → offer revert (`restore_from_backup`, including extra member backups for exploded multi-file batches); keep or revert is logged  
- Re-check itself ends in error verdict → offer revert (logged)  

**Changelog location:**

- Packaged file `book.epub` → `book.epub.checkmate-changelog.md` in the same folder  
- Exploded folder → `checkmate-changelog.md` inside the folder  

Confirm / revert dialogs show the changelog path when present. Open the log anytime via **Report → View edit changelog…** (enabled when a changelog exists for the current publication); it opens in a styled WebView.
